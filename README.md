# iReady-Overload
iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly watch the result of a greedy corporation that doesn't try in any way to make their product enjoyable, or even acceptable, for an hour and a half every single week. This repository is a collection of hacks that ensure nobody has to suffer through iReady ever again. The current version has a lesson and quiz skipper and a minutes hack. You can view older versions of hacks here. There is also a Chrome extension that makes using both of these hacks a lot easier. It is an unpackaged extension, meaning you can install it like this. Additional to the lesson and minutes hack, the extension has a lesson viewer capable of searching through the files and data of an iReady lesson.
